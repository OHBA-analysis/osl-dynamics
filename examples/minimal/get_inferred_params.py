"""Get the inferred parameters for a dataset given by a trained model.

This script will work for any model in osl-dynamics.

For DyNeMo the inferred parameters are the mode mixing coefficients (alpha_jt)
and the inferred covariances.

For the HMM the inferred parameters are the state time course and covariances.
