Nottingham MRC MEGUK
--------------------

The data used in this example is part of the [MRC MEGUK](https://meguk.ac.uk/about/) partnership and is from the Nottingham site. In these scripts we focus on the resting-state (eyes open) MEG data.

Example scripts for preprocessing and source reconstructing CTF data are contained in `/preproc`. Note, the preprocessing and source reconstruction is done with the [OSL](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl) python package (which is not part of osl-dynamics).
