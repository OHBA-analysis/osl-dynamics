"""Example code for plotting connectivity maps using the coherence
from state/mode spectra.

The spectra can be calculate with a multitaper (in the case of a state time
course) or regression (in the case of a mode time course).

See examples/analysis/multitaper_spectra.py for how to calculate a multitaper
and examples/analysis/regression_spectra.py for how to calculate a regression.

In this script we assume this has been done and we have the group-average spectra
files: f.npy and coh.npy. (The other file: psd.npy is not needed for this script.)
