"""Example code for plotting connectivity based on a correlation matrix.

In this example we use the inferred state/mode covariance matrices from
training on time-embedded/PCA data to calculate the state/mode correlation
matrices.

In this script we use an HMM fit, but this can be easily substituted for
a DyNeMo fit.
