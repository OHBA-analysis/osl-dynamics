Current Status
--------------
This package is under active development. Some of the models and analysis functions are still a work in progress.
The completed models (i.e. those without outstanding development plans) are:

- Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
- Dynamic Network Modes (DyNeMo).
- Single-dynamic Adversarial Generator Encoder (SAGE).

The remaining models are still a work in progress, we summarise their status below:

- State Dynamic Network Modelling (State-DyNeMo).

    - Core model has been written.
    - Has not been validated or tested.

- Multi-Dynamic Network Modes (M-DyNeMo).

    - Core model has been written.
    - The model is currently being used to study MEG data. Results have not been finalised.

- Multi-dynamic Adversarial Generator Encoder (MAGE).

    - Core model has been added.
    - This model is currently being tested.
    - A full pipeline example scripts using the model to study fMRI data will be added.

- Subject Embedding Dynamic Network Modes (SE-DyNeMo)

    - Core model is under development.
